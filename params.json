I loved to break things and to pretend I was a Kung Fu master like I saw on tv. I quickly adopted the nickname Master Shefu, before Kung Fu Panda's 'Master Shifu\". I love exploring, climbing things and nice views. 18 years old from Brooklyn, NY, small boy from BD trying to change the world, but not before seeing it all. \r\n\r\n### Brooklyn, NY\r\nHere's some places I've been to in Brooklyn. \r\n\r\n### New York, NY\r\nHere's some places I've been to in Manhattan.\r\n\r\n### Staten Island, NY\r\nHere's some places I've been to in Staten Island.\r\n\r\n### Buffalo, NY\r\nHere's some places I've been to in Buffalo.\r\n\r\n### 2017 Goals\r\nI want to go out there and take more pictures of amazing places. \r\n\r\n### My Instagram\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/mastershefu/\r\n",
